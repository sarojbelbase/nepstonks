### Overview

A channel that publishes latest news & upcoming stocks related to `IPOs`, `FPOs`, `Mutual Funds`, `Right Shares` & `Debentures` and reminds to apply them. It is backed by a `telegram-bot` that does all the heavy lifting i.e. from scraping share related news from the reputed websites to updating with the latest upcoming issues. The upcoming stocks are fetched from an API and get published to this telegram channel, whereas for articles, they are scraped from multiple sources. The most important works are carried by github actions which run these workflows every day at an appointed time frame to check if there are any new issues or articles available, where I don't need to worry about deploying and cron jobs. As an automation-loving guy, I just saved myself many clicks of `sharesansar`, `bizmandu`, `merolagani` or any other similar portals we get these updates from.
